I am thinking of ways to combine American Sign Language (ASL) and tech. Thank you Salesforce and hEr VOLUTION for the amazing experience!" </p>

      <h2> Daniela Uribe | 14 </h2>
      <p> "I didn't know what coding was in the beginning. After I've been in this program for the past week, I found that coding could be extremely fun and interesting while being to create my own webpage. I recommend everyone to do this program!" </p>

      <h2> Madhu Manivannan | 15 </h2>
      <p> "During GO!STEM, I got to meet a lot of girls with similar interests to mine, which in turn lets me now know a strong community that enpowers me and other girls to take initiative and action to empower others in return. I think the camp has helped me a lot in finding a mentor and meeting a lot of awesome people in 4 days. Thanks Salesforce and hEr VOLUTION for the great experience!" </p>
