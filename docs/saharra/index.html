My favourite acvtivites are volleyball, coding and art and I will explain more about it below. This year I am going into High School at Turner Fenton Secondary School.

        <h2>My Favourite things to do</h2>
        <p>Some of the things I like to do is code and play volleyball. I've been coding for about 4 years. In my early stages of coding, I started doing courses at Canada Learning Code, but back then it wasn't called that yet. Each year I would go back and do the summer and march break camps there. As I got older, I out grew the age limit for the camps and found out that I could become a mentor! So I started mentoring there and helping out the little kids.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned before, I also play volleyball. I've been playing for 8 years now. I started taking classes when I was 7 and did little practices with the Pakmen Volleyball Club. Now I play rep volleyball at a profesional level and have been playing at this level for 3 years. In the future, I want to continue playing as well.</p>

        <p>I also love visual and digital art and maybe in the future I will have a career in that industry.</p>
