  <p>Hi! My name is Yathusha Ramanarajah and welcome to the website. I love computer coding and business technology. My love for coding enlarged when I attended the GO!STEM Summer camp run by Salesforce and Hervolution. Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to dig deeper into tech. My goal is to pursue my tech career and  excel in computer coding.  </p>

I am currently looking for an internship with jobs in tech. I am very passionate about business technology and am looking towards making the world a better place to live with my ideas. I am very passionate about getting an education and job in the STEM fields. </p>
